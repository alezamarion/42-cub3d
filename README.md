# 42-cub3d

This is the second graphics project at 42, our first RayCaster with miniLibX.<br>

What is cub3D?<br><br>
Cub3D is a team project at 42 that asks us to create a "3D" game engine with miniLibX. <br>
This project is inspired by the world-famous 90's game Wolfenstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever <br>
The objective of this project is to deep dive into the mathematical concepts behind the ray-casting algorithm such as calculating distances, height, sprite locations and field of view to create a projection using primarily trigonometry. <br>
